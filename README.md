# Project-SignalWave
Project SignalWave is a modern, cloud-native application designed to demonstrate the implementation of microservices architectures within a Kubernetes cluster.
It integrates advanced observability tools and provides a real-world example of how to manage message queues, monitor application performance, and build scalable, resilient systems.

This project is ideal for developers, architects, and DevOps engineers looking to understand and implement best practices for cloud-native development and operations.

#Features
##Microservices Architecture:

Includes a Publisher Service for generating and publishing messages to RabbitMQ.
A Reader Service consumes and processes messages dynamically.
A Frontend Service displays logs in real-time via an enhanced NGINX-hosted HTML page.

##Observability:

Structured logging using Fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana (EFK stack).
Custom metrics collection using Prometheus and visualized in Grafana.

##Scalability and Monitoring:

Demonstrates scalable messaging with RabbitMQ.
Exposes Prometheus metrics to monitor message queue depth, worker throughput, and application latency.

##Cloud-Native Technologies:

Built on Kubernetes with containers orchestrated for high availability.
Incorporates best practices for logging, monitoring, and application observability.

#Use Cases
